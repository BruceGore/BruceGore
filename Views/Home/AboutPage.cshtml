                <h3>Thanks for dropping by to visit my little website!
                    Your host is Bruce W. Gore, M.A., J.D., sponsor, webmaster,
                    teacher, chief cook and bottle washer. You will find here
                    a collection of hundreds of audio and video lectures that
                    I have presented over some 40 years of involvement in
                    Christian education. Many of these have been delivered
                    during the adult education hour of First Presbyterian Church,
                    Spokane (PCUSA), and some date back a few years so the audio
                    quality is not always perfect. Others of these lectures were
                    taken from classroom instruction at Whitworth University,
                    where I served on the adjunct faculty for over 30 years.
                    The subject matter is quite broad, and the collection is
                    growing all the time.</h3>
